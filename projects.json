This means there is a possible lag\nwhile both the partial and any required ajax requests are completed.  To help the user understand this, an overlay is used.\n\nThe overlay watches for `$routeChangeStart`, `$routeChangeSuccess` and `$routeChangeError` to allow it to display and hide itself\nwhile a route change is in progress.",
